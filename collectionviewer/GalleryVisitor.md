This document is intended to help guide visitors through interacting with content on the Omeka Everywhere Collections Viewer. Feel free to modify some of the language to suit your own exhibit space and share it with your visitors. 

## What is this?
This interactive table features items - photographs, documents, and more - from our collections.  

## How do I use it?
The table has a touch screen. You can tap, drag, pinch, spin, and push just like you can on a smartphone or tablet.

**Start**  
You can either tap one of the images in the middle of the table or click one of the areas labeled "Touch to Begin"

**Browsing the Carousel**  
Swipe left or right to scroll through the images in an open carousel viewer, or use the right and left arrows to move one at a time.

**Tap an image**  
Tap an image in the carousel to open it larger on the main viewing area. 

**Zoom, spin, and flip**   
You can an item on the stage using the same sort of gestures you would on a smartphone: 
- Zoom in by pulling apart with two fingers. 
- Zoom out by pinching with two fingers.
- Spin an item by placing a finger on one edge and pulling in a circle.
- Push the item across the table to a friend.

**Filter**  
Tap the filter button in the upper left corner of the carousel to narrow the images in the carousel by a specific keyword.
