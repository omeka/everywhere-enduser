## What is this?
This interactive table features items - photographs, documents, and more - from our collections.  

## How do I use it?
**Open the drawer.** On the long edge of the table is a bar that says "browse." Tap it to open the drawer. 

If you see an alphabetical list and words on the long edge of the table, the drawer is already open. Tap the button on the ends that says "Close" to close it again when you're done, or to give you more room on the main area in the middle.

**Browse the keywords** by scrolling through the alphabet on the left hand side of the drawer.

Tap a letter to pull up the keywords for that letter.

Tap a keyword to populate the right side of the drawer with items. 

Tap the keyword again to remove its tiems from the right side of the drawer.

**Browse the items in the drawer** by swiping left or right to scroll through.

**Move an item from the drawer to the main stage** by tapping it or dragging it up to the stage.

**Zoom, spin, and flip** an item on the stage using the same sort of guestures you would on a smartphone: 
- Zoom in by pulling apart with two fingers. 
- Zoom out by pinching with two fingers.
- Spin an item by placing a finger on one edge and pulling in a circle.
- Push the item across the table to a friend.
- Tap the info icon (i) to flip the item and see more information about it, including title, date, and a description.
