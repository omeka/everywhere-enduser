title: Omeka Everywhere Collections Viewer Gallery Staff Documentation
---
This documentation is intended to give you a basic idea of how the Omeka Everywhere Collection Viewer works, and how to troubleshoot visitor issues.

For the course of the documentation, we use the term "table" to refer to the in-house collection viewer, but this may be a tablet or other windows-capable touchscreen device.

Once the Omeka Everywhere Collection Viewer is running, the table will display an attract pool of four images which will rotate in and out. 

Users can begin engaging with the table either by  
1. tapping one of the items in the attract pool or
2. by tapping on one of the "Touch to Being" buttons.

Tapping on an item in the attract pool will open up an information viewer, showing the item's basic information. 

## Carousel Viewer

Tapping on "Touch to Begin" opens a carousel viewer at that location on the table, where viewers can scroll through items with a swipe motion, or click through one at a time with the left and right arrows.  

Text below the item image gives the current item out of the whole, for example "7 of 408" would mean the visitor was viewing the seventh out of a total of 408 items.

To see a larger version of an item in the carousel and learn more about it, visitors simply tap on the item in the carousel. This will open the item on the table.

### Filtering 
Visitors can limit the number of items in the carousel by specific keywords by clicking on the "filter" button on the upper left-hand corner of the carousel.

Select a keyword to filter the carousel results by tapping on the word or phrase. The carousel will automatically update its displayed items.

Once a filter is selected, it will appear at the top of the filter list. Visitors can dismiss the filter and reset the items displayed on the carousel using the "X" button on the right end of the filter label. 

Selecting a new filter will replace the previous one.

## Items on the Table

Visitors can interact with the items on the main area of the table in the following ways:  
- *pinch or pull* to zoom out or in;
- *drag or push* to move;
- *tap the i button* to see information;
- *tap the x button* to remove the item from the viewing area.

Please note that a visitor can only have five items open on the table at a time. 

## Connecting Mobile Device and Table

### Pairing
Once a visitor has installed an Omeka Everywhere app on their mobile device, they can pair their device with the table.

To start, they visitor clicks the *Send to Mobile* button on the upper right-hand corner of their media viewer (where the Carousel is). A window will appear to the right of their media viewer, in the same color, with a four digit code.

On their mobile device, visitors open the application running Omeka Everywhere and go to settings. There, they select "Pair with Exhibit Collection Viewer" and enter the four-digit code displayed on the table (NB They will need to have bluetooth turned on for this to work).

Once the devices are successfully paired, the area where the code displayed becomes the "drop zone" with the message "drag files here to send to mobile app"

### Sending items from Table to Mobile 

To send an item from the table to their mobile device, the visitor drags the item from the table (main area or carousel) over the drop zone. 

When the item begins to send, the icon on the drop zone will change to look similar to the WiFi symbol. If the transmission is successful, the drop zone displays a checkmark and success message.

The drop zone will reset the message after a few seconds, but visitors can immediately send another item to their device it they wish (even while the success message is displayed).

### Unpairing
To unpair, the visitor clicks the "tap to unpair" button on the media viewer (where the "send to mobile" message displayed). They can also tap unpair on their device at any time.
