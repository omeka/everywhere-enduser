This documentation is intended to give you a basic idea of how the Omeka Everywhere Collection Viewer works, and how to troubleshoot visitor issues.


Once the Omeka Everywhere Collection Viewer is running, the table will display an attract pool of four images which will rotate in and out. 

Users can begin engaging with the table either by  
1. tapping one of the items in the attract pool or
2. by tapping on one of the "Touch to Being" buttons.

Tapping on an item in the attract pool will open up an information viewer, showing the item's basic information. 

**Carousel Viewer**

Tapping on "Touch to Begin" opens a carousel viewer at that location on the table, where viewers can scroll through items with a swipe motion or click through one at a time with the left and right arrows.  

To see a larger version of an item in the carousel and learn more about it, visitors simply tap on the item in the carousel. This will open the item on the table.

Visitors can limit the number of items in the carousel by specific keywords by clicking on the "filter" button on the upper left-hand corner of the carousel. 

Once a filter is selected, it will appear at the top of the filter list, where visitors can dismiss it using the "X" button on the right end of the filter label. Selecting a new filter will replace the previous one.

**Items on the Table**

Visitors can interact with the items on the main area of the table in the following ways:  
- *pinch or pull* to zoom out or in;
- *drag or push* to move;
- *tap the i button* to see information;
- *tap the x button* to remove the item from the viewing area.

Please note that a visitor can only have five items open on the table at a time.
