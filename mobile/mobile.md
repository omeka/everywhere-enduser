## Adding new sites
In order for an Omeka Classic site to be able to serve content to the mobile app, it must have the [API enabled](http://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Settings/API_Settings/).

To add content from the Omeka Classic site to the app: 

1. Open the app on a mobile device
2. Click on the gear icon to open the Settings page.
3. From the Settings page, click the Omeka Sites option.
4. Using the field toward the bottom of the screen, enter the url of the Omeka site (the base url, without `/api` at the end). When you are typing, the text will display in red until you have a valid url, at which point it will turn green.
