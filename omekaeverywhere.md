title: Omeka Everywhere

Omeka Everywhere is a suite of solutions which help institutions to make selected content of their Omeka Classic sites available to visitors on mutlitouch tables and in custom smartphone apps, and to send their favorite items from these interactives to themselves or share on social media. 

Omeka Everywhere Collections Viewer
-----------------------------------
The Omeka Everywhere Collection Viewer (OECV) allows you to connect an existing Omeka Classic installation to a multi-touch table or tablet for an in-gallery experience.

Using the built-in API in your Omeka site, OECV pulls content from a collection of your choice to your multi-touch table or tablet. Visitors then browse by tags, which are organized alphabetically in a drawer at the bottom of the screen or the long edges of the table. Each time a visitor selects a tag (up to three at a time), items with the tag load in the drawer. Visitors can select items to go up on the stage, where they can pinch to zoom, flip the item over to view its metadata, and even push the item across the table to a friend on the other side.
